# apocaLISP

apocaLISP is a work-in-progress LISP interpreter aimed at being a fully compliant implementation of [Make a LISP(MAL)](https://github.com/kanaka/mal).

I'm writing it mostly to learn more about programming language interpreter internals.
The parser was hand-written, not generated by applying [Backus-Naur forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form).

Currently it supports the following features:
- A dynamic typing system(signed integers, signed floats, strings, booleans, nil, functions and atoms).
- Atoms: a Closure-inspired type to manage state via functional application.
- Eager and lazy evaluation.
- Lexical scoping.
- Higher order functions, including full closure support.
- Loading and interpreting programmes from external files.

It leverages two test suites: one inherited from MAL, and one written by me, for when I want to have finer grained control of the executable specification.

At some point I might transform apocaLISP into a full blown shell, replacing `/bin/sh` on my workstations.
